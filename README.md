# Boombox Playlists mod
This is a mod which allows users to add custom playlists to the boombox item inside Lethal Company
# Installation
This mod requires: `BepInEx`
It can be installed either by compiling the source code into a .dll file (I won't specify how to do this here, anyone who is interested probably knows how) or through the Thunderstore Mod Manager
# Usage
This mod reads the required files (supported formats are `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.mp3`) from the folder `Lethal Company/BepInEx/Custom Playlists/`, inside this folder you may create as many folders as you like, each one will be a separate playlist, e.g.
```
Lethal Company/BepInEx/Custom Playlists/
  ├── Playlist A
  |   ├── Song 1
  |   ├── Song 2
  |   └── Song 3
  └── Playlist B
      ├── Song 1
      └── Song 2
```
